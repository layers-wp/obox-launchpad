A WordPress plugin that deploys a beautiful, responsive Coming Soon or Down for Maintenance page for your site. Collect emails, change styles, show social links and more.

Set your launch date, add your copy and go! Or customize and tweak to get the exact holding page you want before you launch your site.

Launchpad can be used with any WordPress install. As long as you have a site and as long as you have WordPress then Launchpad will work for you.

**Just set the date and go**
With minimal setup required, you can simply set your launch date, hit activate and you're good to go!

**Save face with Auto Launch**
There is nothing more frustrating than forgetting to turn off maintenance mode as you go live, so we've included an 'Auto Launch' switch which will help you save face when you go live.

**Works with any WordPress theme**
It doesn't matter whether you use an Obox Theme, a free theme or even a custom built theme, Launchpad will work on any kind of WordPress installment.

Select one of our three preset settings or add your Typekit ID and showcase a beautiful landing page with your favorite font!

**Eleven gorgeous backgrounds**
We have included eleven amazing backgrounds to can choose from, however if you decide that you want something more unique, simply upload your own custom BG.

**Drag and Drop the layout**
Use the drag and drop layout manager to determine how you want to organize your landing page elements. Move the timer to the top, logo to the bottom or video to the middle. It's really easy.

**Take full control with custom css**
Not satisfied with the default settings? No problem, add your own custom css via the settings area and turn the landing page into a truly unique destination for your new site.

**Subscriber sign up form**
